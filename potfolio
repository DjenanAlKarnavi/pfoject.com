# C# Projects

These are some small projects I made using C# and the .NET Framework.

## Projects

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

### NFL Stats
This is a data visualization application designed to store and display football stats for fantasy football purposes. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6 for data access and follows a Code First workflow. This project is still a work in progress.
